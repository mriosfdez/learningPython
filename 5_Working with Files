Working with files: 

Opening basic text files. 

You may need to open .txt files programmatically and then read or write to them. 

Python has built in capabilities to open basic text files. 

It can open other file types such as .csv or PDF

pwd = to know where you are

How to open files in the same directory that you are: 
myfile.open("text_file_name")
myfile.read() = brings back in a string the whole text inside the text file. 
myfile.seek(0) = returns the cursor to the beginning of the file so we can read it again
myfile.readlines = returns back a lists of every item as a single line
myfile.close = to close the text file


myfile = open("test_file.txt")
lines = myfile.read()
print(lines)
myfile.close()
 
 =

with open("test_file.txt") as myfile:
    lines = myfile.read()
    
 print(lines)
 
 f = open("test_file.txt",mode="r") == to read the test file / ("test_file.txt","r")
 f.read()
 
 f.close()
 
 f = open("test_file.txt",mode="w")
 f.write("new line")
 
 f.close()
 
 with open("test_file.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())
  
  When we use the "w" mode overwrites the file. 
  
  with open("slñjfdfa.txt","a") as f:
    f.write("\nsome other line")
    
  with open("slñjfdfa.txt","r") as f:
    print(f.read())
    
  To append content
