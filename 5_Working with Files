Working with files: 

Opening basic text files. 

You may need to open .txt files programmatically and then read or write to them. 

Python has built in capabilities to open basic text files. 

It can open other file types such as .csv or PDF


pwd = to know where you are

How to open files in the same directory that you are: 

open() - Built-in Function that opens a file and returns a file object. 

open(path_to_file)


Files modes to open: 
r = Open for reading(default)
w = Open for writing, truncating first
x = Create a new file and open it for writing
a = Open for writing, appending to file 

+ = Open a file for updating (read/write)
b = Binary mode (images, videos and compress files among others)
t = Text mode(default) 


open("/pics/cat.jpg",rb)


Carriage returns and Line Feeds
\r = Carriage Return
\n = New line
\r\n = Windows style line endings
\n = Mac line endings 

myfile.open("text_file_name")
myfile.read() = returns in a string the whole text inside the text file. Then the current position will be the actual end of the file. So if you call read() again an empty string will be return since there are no more data to show. 
myfile.read(3) = returns the position 3(byte) of the file
myfile.seek(offset) = change the current position to offeset. 
myfile.seek(0) = returns the cursor to the beginning of the file so we can read it again
myfile.seek(5) = returns the 5byte of the file
myfile.tell() = returns the current position in the file. 
myfile.readlines = returns back a lists of every item as a single line
myfile.close() = to close the text file

To automatically close a file use: 

with open(file_path) as file_object_variable_name:
  code block
  
To read a line at a time, use a for loop: 
with open(file.txt) as the_file:
  for line in the_file:
    print(line.rstrip())
    


myfile = open("test_file.txt")
lines = myfile.read()
print(lines)
myfile.close()
 
 =

with open("test_file.txt") as myfile:
    lines = myfile.read()
    
 print(lines)
 
 f = open("test_file.txt",mode="r") == to read the test file / ("test_file.txt","r")
 f.read()
 
 f.close()
 
 f = open("test_file.txt",mode="w")
 f.write("new line")
 
 f.close()
 
 with open("test_file.txt") as f:
  print(f.read())
  
  When we use the "w" mode overwrites the file. 
  
  with open("slñjfdfa.txt","a") as f:
    f.write("\nsome other line")
    
  with open("slñjfdfa.txt","r") as f:
    print(f.read())
