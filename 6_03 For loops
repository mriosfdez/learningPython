For loops

Many objects in Python are "iterable", meaning we can iterate over every element in the objetct. 

Such as every element in a list or every characters in a string.

We can use for loops to execute a block of code for every iteration. 

mylist = [1,2,3]
for item in mylist:
  print(item)
  
  >> 1
  >>2
  >> 3
  
  for num in mylist:
    print(num,end=" ")
    ### to print out just in one line. 
    
    >> 1 2 3 4
