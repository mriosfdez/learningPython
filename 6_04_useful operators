RANGE: Use for iterating, but does not save it 

for num in range(0,11):
    print(num)
    
for num in range(0,101,5):
    print(num)
    
ENUMERATE: creates a list of tuples where the first item in the tuple is the count where you are, 

ZIP: to add several lists together and get back a tuple. Although you can also get the result as a list. 

mylist1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
mylist2 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

for item in zip(mylist1,mylist2):
    print(item)
    
 list(zip(mylist1,mylist2))
 
 You will only zip at the point of the shortert list. 

IN operator: to check if something is inside some object 
 
MAX and MIN operator: to check the max and min value in a list
 
max(mylist)
min(mylist)


from random import shuffle == desordena la lista 
shuffle(mylist)

from random import randint == saca un n√∫mero aletario 
randint(0,100)

AND / OR / NOT = para booleanos
