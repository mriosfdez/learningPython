Object Oriented Programming (OOP) allows programmers to create their own objects that have methods and attributes.

Recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them with the .method_name() syntax. 

OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized. 

class NameOfClass():  ## class names have to be in capital letters

    def __init__(self,param1,param2):    ### init method
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2
        
    def some_method(self):
        ## perform some action
        print(self.param1)
