Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types. 

They use [] and commas to separate objects in the list. 

Lists support indexing and slicing. 

Lists can be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them. 

mylist.append(x) = appends what's inside the ()
mylist.pop() = removes the latest item in the list
mylist.pop(0) = removes the first item 
mylist.reverse() = reverse the list content
mylist.sort() = sorts the list content in order 
mylist.insert(position, item) = inserts a new item at the given position
