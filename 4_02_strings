Strings are an ordered sequence of characters enclosed with either single or double quotes. 

Since they are ordered we can use indexing to retrieve individual characters or slicing to retrieve a subsection of the original string. 

** These actions use [] and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab

Index starts at 0 

Python also supports reverse indexing. Useful when you don't know how long is your string. 

** For slice notation, [] are also used with the format: [start:stop:step]

- start is a numerical index for the slice start.
- stop is the index you will go up to but not include
- step is how large of a jump to make between characters

basic methods: 

stringname.upper() = will uppercase everything
stringname.lower() = will lowercase everything
stringname.split() = splits on a particular character, by default splits the split in spaces
stringname.split(o) = will splits on "o"

print formatting: 
Example: print("The {a} needs to {b}".format(a=user_name,b=action))
