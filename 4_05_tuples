Tuples are very similar to a list. 

Tuples are ordered sequences of objetcts. They used ()

tuple_name = (item1, item2, item2)

They are immutable. You can not change a value. Once you've assigned an object to a position in a tuple, you cannot reassign it. 

Values accessed by index. 

Iteration, looping and concatenation. 

for item_variable in tuple_name:
    code block

Use when data sould not change. 

tuples.count()
tuples.index()
tuple_name[index]
del tuple_name = to delete de tuple 

list() = Built-in function returns a list. 
tuple() = Built-in function returns a tuple. 
type() = Built-in function returns an object's type. 
max()
min() 

You can use tuple assignment to assign values to multiple variables at once and it can be used in for loops: 
(var1, varN,) = (value1, valueN)
