Control flow allow us to add logic to our code.

We can specify under what conditions we want certain code to execute.

To do this, we use the if, elif and else statements. 

Comparison Operators: 

> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to
== Equals
!= not equal 

Control flow will use boolean conditions to decide whether or not to execute a block of code. 

Recall that booleans are True or False objects. 

Comparisson operations will return boolean values that we can use for control flow. 

Control flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (whitespace)

if some_condition:
  # execute some code
  
 if 1==2:
  print("Whoah")
 elif 1==1:
  print("One if equal to one")
 else:
  print("Everything normal")
