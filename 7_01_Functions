Functions

Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer.

Functions allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily execute multiple times, without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code.

- def name_of_function():

    print("hello")
    
- def name_of_function(Hopper)
    print("hello"+ name)
    
 We use the return keyword to send back the result of the function, instead of just printing it out.
 
 return allow us to assign the output of the function to a new variable. 
 
 def add_function(num1,num2):
  return num1 + num2
